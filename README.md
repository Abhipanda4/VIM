# VIM Configuration Files
A custom tweaked vimrc file suited to my personal tastes.
## Steps for setup:
* Clone the repo
* Create a symlink to vimrc in your home folder:

 `$ln -s VIM/.vimrc ~/.vimrc`
 
 This would emulate the presence of a vimrc file in your home directory.
 
 * It is advisable to delete the .vim directory and start fresh. So create a new .vim directory:
 
 `mkdir .vim`
 
 * open vim & run 
 
 `: PluginInstall`
